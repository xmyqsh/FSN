# FSN
Fully Sparse Network

```
6.5 FPS on Waymo Open Dataset

Easy to learn, no more than 4 epcho for training

No ground plane detection, no class-wise balancing, no ensemble, one model result

No FPN, one scale feature detection

No history or futher data using, on using current frame.

In a word, just a innovate new feature has been used, no bells and whistles.

```


```
It is just a new, coarse, easy to learn framework.
Can be further optimize from speed to accuracy.

`APH` could be fixed in a new way.
All of the current good angle direction classification tools will hurt or slow down AP in FSN more or less.

What interesting is that the current result of FSN on the Challenge leadboard with a buggy angle direction classifier has the best AP of all with 4 epoch training time.
